## Background

HeroesOfPymoli

In this challenge, we take on the role of a Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. We've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company requests that we generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

My final report will include the following:

- Player Count
- Purchasing Analysis (Total)
- Gender Demographics
- Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
- Age Demographics
- Top Spenders
- Most Popular Items
- Most Profitable Items

We were instructed to use Pandas Library, Jupyter Notebook, and submit a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
